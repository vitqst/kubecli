Here‚Äôs a clear and structured **desktop app requirements document** based on the provided image and your notes ‚Äî describing an app that manages Kubernetes resources with console integration.

# üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Application Requirements: Kubernetes Resource Manager**

## **1. Overview**

This desktop application provides an interactive interface to manage Kubernetes clusters.
It allows switching between contexts, listing and editing resources (Pods, Services, Deployments, CronJobs, ConfigMaps, Secrets), and includes an integrated **native console** for command-line operations.

---

## **2. Functional Requirements**

### **2.1 Context Management**

* **Select Context**

  * The user can view and select available Kubernetes contexts (from local `~/.kube/config`).
  * Display currently active context.
  * Option to refresh context list.
  * When a new context is selected, all resource lists and console sessions update accordingly.

---

### **2.2 Resource Type Selection**

* **Select Resource Type**

  * Dropdown or segmented control with options:

    * `Pods`
    * `Services`
    * `Deployments`
    * `CronJobs`
    * `ConfigMaps`
    * `Secrets`
  * Selecting a type updates the resource list panel.

---

### **2.3 Resource List Panel**

* **List Resources**

  * Display all resources of the selected type in the active context.
  * Each resource entry includes:

    * Resource name
    * Namespace
    * Status (if applicable)
  * Each entry includes:

    * **[EDIT]** button ‚Äî opens the resource manifest in the console editor.
    * **[VIEW]** button (optional) ‚Äî opens read-only mode in the console.

* **Filtering and Search**

  * Provide text search by name or namespace.

---

### **2.4 Console Panel**

* **Native Console Integration**
  * Use sameway with the vscode did ( use native console for user familiar )
  * The main panel is a native terminal emulator (e.g., xterm.js or Electron Terminal API).
  * Allows direct command execution (`kubectl`, `helm`, etc.).
  * Can be used to edit resource YAMLs directly (`kubectl edit`).
  * Auto-fills resource commands based on context and selection.
  * Supports:

    * Color output
    * Scrolling and resizing
    * Copy/paste operations

---

### **2.5 Resource Editing**

* **Edit in Console**

  * Clicking **[EDIT]** opens the selected resource‚Äôs YAML manifest in the console using an inline editor.
  * After editing, changes can be saved back to the cluster using `kubectl apply`.

## **3. UI Layout Requirements**

| Section          | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Left Sidebar** | Contains context selector, resource type selector, and list of resources with edit buttons. |
| **Main Panel**   | A large integrated console area for command execution and editing YAML files.               |
| **Color Theme**  | Soft pastel background (like light yellow) and a dark console area (black/grey).            |
| **Style**        | Rounded corners, minimalistic, terminal-focused layout.                                     |

## **4. Technical Requirements**

### **4.1 Platform**

* Desktop application built using:

  * **Electron.js** (for cross-platform desktop support)
  * **React** (for UI)
  * **kubectl** integration (executed through Node child processes)

### **4.2 Data Source**

* Kubernetes configuration loaded from `~/.kube/config`
* Resource data fetched via `kubectl get -o json`
