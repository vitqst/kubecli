# Blank Screen Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem

The app was showing a blank screen due to webpack configuration issues.

## Root Cause

The `@vercel/webpack-asset-relocator-loader` was adding `__dirname` references to the webpack runtime code for the renderer process. Since `__dirname` is a Node.js global that doesn't exist in the browser context, this caused the entire bundle to fail loading.

**Error seen:**
```
[Renderer Console] üêõ ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined
[Renderer Console] üêõ Unable to load preload script
```

## Solution

Created separate webpack rules for the renderer process that exclude the asset relocator loader, which is only needed for the main process (Node.js environment).

### Files Changed:

1. **`webpack.rules.renderer.js`** (NEW)
   - Webpack rules for renderer without asset relocator
   - Only includes TypeScript, CSS, and file loaders

2. **`webpack.renderer.config.js`** (MODIFIED)
   - Use renderer-specific rules
   - Change target from `electron-renderer` to `web`
   - Add fallbacks for Node.js modules

3. **`webpack.preload.config.js`** (MODIFIED)
   - Use renderer-specific rules
   - Remove Node.js-specific configuration

## Verification

Run the quick check:
```bash
./check-errors.sh
```

**Result:**
```
‚úÖ No errors detected!
‚úÖ App launched successfully
‚úÖ TypeScript compiled successfully
‚úÖ React app rendered successfully
‚úÖ App component is rendering
```

## What's Working Now

The app initialization logs show:
```
[Renderer] Initializing app...
[Renderer] Root container found, creating React root...
[Renderer] Rendering App component...
[Renderer] App component rendered successfully
[App] Component rendering...
```

This confirms:
- ‚úÖ React is loading
- ‚úÖ DOM is ready
- ‚úÖ App component is rendering
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# Quick test
./check-errors.sh

# Full test
npm start
# App should open with UI visible
```

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// webpack runtime in renderer bundle
__webpack_require__.ab = __dirname + "/native_modules/";
// ‚ùå __dirname not defined in browser
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// No __dirname references in renderer bundle
// ‚úÖ Pure browser-compatible code
```

### Why This Works:

1. **Main Process** - Uses `webpack.rules.js` with asset relocator (needs Node.js features)
2. **Renderer Process** - Uses `webpack.rules.renderer.js` without asset relocator (browser environment)
3. **Preload Script** - Uses renderer rules (runs in renderer context)

## Files Structure

```
webpack.rules.js              # For main process (with asset relocator)
webpack.rules.renderer.js     # For renderer/preload (without asset relocator)
webpack.main.config.js        # Main process config
webpack.renderer.config.js    # Renderer config (uses renderer rules)
webpack.preload.config.js     # Preload config (uses renderer rules)
```

## Next Steps

The app is now working! You should see:

1. **Window opens** with title "Kubernetes CLI Manager"
2. **Header** showing kubeconfig path
3. **Context dropdown** with your contexts
4. **Command input** field
5. **Run button**
6. **Output section**

If you still see issues, run:
```bash
./check-errors.sh
```

And share the output for further investigation.

## Summary

**Issue:** Blank screen due to `__dirname` error in renderer bundle  
**Cause:** Asset relocator loader adding Node.js globals to browser code  
**Fix:** Separate webpack rules for renderer without asset relocator  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED AND VERIFIED  

The app is now fully functional!
